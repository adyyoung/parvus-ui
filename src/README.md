# parvus-ui

A very small UI component library for React apps. It includes theming, probably all the generic components you need, and it also includes layout components using the very popular and powerful flexbox (we've also tried to keep things as consistent with popular technologies as possible to try and make it as easy as possible to figure out and to find docs for).

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Run the example app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```
$ npm start
```

Run tests and watch for code changes using [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest):

```
$ npm test
```

Lint `src` and `test` files:

```
$ npm run lint
```
